# Case study: Cyclistic
\


##  Contents

This website contains  two approaches to the data analysis case study project from start to end:\
\

- **Project in SQL and Tableau:**\
  -- This was my **first approach** within the course. Its focus was on big data wrangling and quick visualization in Tableau\
  -- The used dataset and cleaning process was later updated to be comparable with the project in R\
  -- The project is embedded in a R Markdown document\
\

- **Project in R:**\
  -- This was my **second approach** using R. This project is digging a little bit deeper utilizing some of R's capabilities\
  -- Some statistics and advanced visualizations have been applied to find deeper insights\
\

All steps are documented in R Markdown with the relevant SQL and R codes. All codes are executable from the R Markdown documents available on GitHub [Link](https://github.com/hk-schaefer/Cyclistic).\

The analysis in Tableau with dashboards and story point is available in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hartmut.schaefer/viz/Bike-ShareCaseStudy-GoogleDataAnalyticsCapStoneProject/Cyclistics-StoryPoint).\
