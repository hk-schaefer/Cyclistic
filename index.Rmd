## Google Data Analytics Specialization - CapStone Project
\


###  Contents

This website contains  two approaches to the data analysis case study project from start to end:\
\

- **Approach 1:** data cleaning in SQL/ data analysis in Tableau\
\

- **Approach 2:** data cleaning and data analysis in R\
\

All steps are documents in R Markdown including SQL and R codes. All codes are executable from the R Markdown documents under the condition that the data are downloaded and a connection to the SQL Server is established.\

The analysis in Tableau is only documented in screenshots. The original dashboards and story point are available in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hartmut.schaefer/viz/Bike-ShareCaseStudy-GoogleDataAnalyticsCapStoneProject/Cyclistics-StoryPoint).\
