Google Data Analytics Specialization Course - Coursera



The specialization course finishes with a capstone project. I chose case study 1 "Cyclistic: A Bike-share program in Chicago".
The difficulty in this case study was the huge amount of data (over 5 million observations).

The task of this case study was to identify differences between two user groups.

In this repo you will find two approaches to the task:


1. Approach 1: Using SQL for data cleaning and Tableau for exploration and visualization

    - the SQL code is documented in code chunks within the Rmd file
    - all steps are explained in the in line text
    - the Tableau visualization and dashboards are document as screenshots. The original can be found on Tableau Public



2. Approach 2: Using R for data cleaning, exploration and visualization

    - the R code is documented in code chunks in the Rmd file
    - all steps are explained in the in line text
